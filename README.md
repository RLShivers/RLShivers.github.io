Pac man project

Description and usage:
This is a simple program to show the ability of creating funtions to buttons, everytime you hit the add pacman button a new pacman enters the screen in a random speed and direction.

Future:
The first update with be figuring out how to make use of all four images to give the game a more dynamic feel. Maybe I can figure out how to add some sound as well and maybe add a second button to kill the pacmen


Eye Of Sauron project

Description and usage:
This is a simple program to show the ability to create funtions based on movement of the mouse.

Future: I should probably do the projects as it was directed with 2 eyes but this was more fun playing with css.

Live bus tracker

Description and usage:
This project was difficult using outside data to show the location of the bus in real time. 

Future:
I would like to make it a bit more dynamic, I would like to change the map to a satalite image and maybe show multiple bus lines at the same time.
