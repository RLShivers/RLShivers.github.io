Pac man project


Description and usage:
This is a simple program to show the ability of creating funtions to buttons, everytime you hit the add pacman button a new pacman enters the screen in a random speed and direction.

Future:
The first update with be figuring out how to make use of all four images to give the game a more dynamic feel. Maybe I can figure out how to add some sound as well and maybe add a second button to kill the pacmen
